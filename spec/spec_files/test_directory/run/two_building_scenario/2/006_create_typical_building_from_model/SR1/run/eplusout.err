   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS OFF DISCRETE", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS ON CONTINUOUS", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 13 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** GetInternalHeatGains: People="FULLSERVICERESTAURANT DINING PEOPLE 1" has comfort related schedules but no thermal comfort model selected.
   **   ~~~   ** If schedules are specified for air velocity, clothing insulation, and/or work efficiency but no thermal comfort
   **   ~~~   ** thermal comfort model is selected, the schedules will be listed as unused schedules in the .err file.
   **   ~~~   ** To avoid these errors, select a valid thermal comfort model or eliminate these schedules in the PEOPLE input.
   ** Warning ** GetInternalHeatGains: People="FULLSERVICERESTAURANT KITCHEN PEOPLE 1" has comfort related schedules but no thermal comfort model selected.
   **   ~~~   ** If schedules are specified for air velocity, clothing insulation, and/or work efficiency but no thermal comfort
   **   ~~~   ** thermal comfort model is selected, the schedules will be listed as unused schedules in the .err file.
   **   ~~~   ** To avoid these errors, select a valid thermal comfort model or eliminate these schedules in the PEOPLE input.
   ** Warning ** GetDaylightingControls: Fraction of Zone controlled by the Daylighting reference points is < 1.0.
   **   ~~~   ** ..discovered in "Daylighting:Controls" for Zone="BUILDING STORY 1 THERMALZONE", only 0.48 of the zone is controlled.
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ************* Beginning Plant Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=BOOSTER WATER LOOP PUMP
   ** Warning ** SizePlantLoop: Calculated Plant Sizing Design Volume Flow Rate=[0.00] is too small. Set to 0.0
   **   ~~~   ** ..occurs for PlantLoop=HOT WATER LOOP
   ** Warning ** SizePump: Calculated Pump Nominal Volume Flow Rate=[0.00] is too small. Set to 0.0
   **   ~~~   ** ..occurs for Pump=HOT WATER LOOP PUMP
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=HOT WATER LOOP PUMP
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal flow rate is set or calculated = 0, for pump=HOT WATER LOOP PUMP
   ** Warning ** Missing temperature setpoint for LeavingSetpointModulated mode Boiler named BOILER
   **   ~~~   **   A temperature setpoint is needed at the outlet node of a boiler in variable flow mode
   **   ~~~   **   use a Setpoint Manager to establish a setpoint at the boiler outlet node 
   **   ~~~   **   or use an EMS actuator to establish a setpoint at the boiler outlet node 
   **   ~~~   **   The overall loop setpoint will be assumed for Boiler. The simulation continues ...

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
